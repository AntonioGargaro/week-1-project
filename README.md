## Horoscope Generator 
![Screenshot](screenshotwebpage.png)

## Motivation
We were tasked with making a webpage that would change display depending on the input. We also had to consider site responsiveness and semantic HTML to make sure the site was fully accessible.  This website is a horoscope generator that returns your horoscope depending on birthday and a zodiac animal depending on birth year.

## Stretch Goals

Our website accessibilty audit on Chrome got an initial score of 100 but we added further semantic HTML elements to improve it. For client-side validation we added a alert if a name was less than three characters and disabled the other form elements until a name was submitted. 
In the future we want to add a visual validation when a name was submitted for the user and further improve the aesthetic of the website.
