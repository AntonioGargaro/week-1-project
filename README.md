![Screenshot](screenshotwebpage.png)

## Motivation
We were tasked with making a webpage that would change display depending on the input. We also had to consider site responsiveness and semantic HTML to make sure the site was fully accessible.  This website is a horoscope generator that returns your horoscope depending on birthday and a zodiac animal depending on birth year.
